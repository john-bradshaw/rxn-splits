# Full exports

This directory contains some of the fully exported recent Conda/Mamba environments that were actually used. 
While I don't suggest using these environments directly (they are likely overly aggressive in terms 
of the version pinning), they may be helpful for debugging purposes, particularly if incompatibilities between packages
are introduced in the future. The platform was `linux-64` and we used Micromamba for the installation.
